Here's a summary of the noticeable html tags used in the hoomepage

**Image tag <img>**
> Google logo the image tag <img> was used nto embed the image in the html page.

To do this ``<img src="path to img file" alt="Text to show if broken image" width="500" height="600">``


**Anchor tag <a>**
> It was used to attach a link to a different page, so when the text or image is clicked a different page is opened

To do this
``<a href="Link to embed">Text content to show</a>``
  
**Button tag <button>**
In this case some of the clickable buttons had a link to another page attached example is the 
* Google search button
* I am feeling lucky button
These buttons had an anchor tag attached to link a different page when clicked
 

**Horizontal rule tag**
> Was used to define the break in the HTML doc, more like a little border between two sections

**Underline tag**
> When the mouse hovers around each clickable text, the underlined tag was activated

**Unordered list tag**
> Used to create the list of supported languages by google.
